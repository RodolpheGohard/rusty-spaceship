# Ludum Dare #46 Entry

**TLDR; run the game in your browser at https://rodolphegohard.github.io/rusty-spaceship/** , _source code at https://github.com/RodolpheGohard/rusty-spaceship_

You’re the handyman for a spaceship decades old, it barely can fly, thanks to you. You have to repair everything aboard to keep it alive.

This is my first jam, it was nice participating, but so tiring and hard ! Thanks for testing. Please report bugs and feel free to comment. I made the code, graphics (if we can call them that) sounds and music on my own.

To play, Just visit the site. you need a decent browser, it uses ES6 syntax and modules. https://rodolphegohard.github.io/rusty-spaceship/
